## Install

### Via Composer

Install the Laravel-lang package to your Laravel project with composer using command from the table below based on the version of Laravel you are using:

| Laravel version                     | Composer command                                  |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Laravel 7-8 with Php Intl           | `composer require laravel-lang/lang:~8.0` |
| Laravel 8.x                         | `composer require laravel-lang/lang:~7.0` |
| Laravel 7.x and new directory names | `composer require laravel-lang/lang:~7.0` |
| Laravel 7.x                         | `composer require laravel-lang/lang:~6.1` |
| Laravel 6.x                         | `composer require laravel-lang/lang:~5.0` |
| Laravel 5.8                         | `composer require laravel-lang/lang:~4.0` |
| Laravel 5.1-5.7                     | `composer require laravel-lang/lang:~3.0` |
| Laravel 5                           | `composer require laravel-lang/lang:~2.0` |
| Laravel 4                           | `composer require laravel-lang/lang:~1.0` |

#### Copy files

After adding the dependency using composer (as described above) to your application you can find the language files under the directory `vendor/laravel-lang/lang`.

Copy the folders (and JSON files) of languages that you want to use, into the directory `resources/lang` of your Laravel application (or `app/lang` in Laravel 4).

If you are using Laravel Mix, add `mix.copy('vendor/laravel-lang/lang/src/ms', 'resources/lang/ms');` to your `webpack.mix.js` to let mix automatically copy the directory every time you compile.

* Copy the folders of languages that you want, in `resources/lang` folder of your Laravel application (or `app/lang` in Laravel 4).
