# Copy files

After adding the dependency using composer (as described above) to your application you can find the language files under the
directory `vendor/laravel-lang/lang`.

Copy the folders (and JSON files) of languages that you want to use, into the directory `resources/lang` of your Laravel application (or `app/lang` in Laravel
4).
